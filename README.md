How to Download Bitcoin Historical Price Data 
Install dependencies from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt


üîë API Keys

Go to CoinGecko API docs
.

Create a file named keys.json in your project folder:

{
  "x-cg-demo-api-key": "YOUR_DEMO_KEY",
  "x-cg-pro-api-key":  "YOUR_PRO_KEY"
}


Update the file path in the script if needed.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit your real keys.json ‚Äî only keep it locally. A sample file (keys.json.sample) is included here.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Run the script:

python btc_history_example.py


Expected output (Demo mode):

Loaded demo key (last 4): XXXX
PING: {'gecko_says': '(V3) To the Moon!'}
First 2 prices: [[TIMESTAMP, PRICE], [TIMESTAMP, PRICE]]
Saved sheet 'btc_7d_usd' in crypto_market_data.xlsx


This creates crypto_market_data.xlsx with a clean sheet of historical data.

‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Change these parameters to suit your needs:

params ‚Üí

vs_currency: "usd", "eur", "sgd", etc.

days: "1", "7", "30", "90", "max"

interval: "daily", "hourly"

sheet_name: rename the Excel sheet (e.g., btc_30d_eur).

out_path: set the filename/path of the Excel workbook.

üöÄ Switching to Pro

To use the Pro API, update these lines:

key = get_pro_key()
headers = {"accept": "application/json", "x-cg-pro-api-key": key}
base_url = PUB_PRO_URL


Everything else remains the same.
